# ZooFileWriterApp
Project 3 CS 210
This is a repository for my Project 3 submission for a zoo file writer application. In this project, we created an application which allowed users to make and create a zoo animal directory, with the ability to import txt files from a java class. The main application was written in C++ and consists of an Animal class which all other classes inherit from. I believe this project particularly showcases my problem solving skills as well as my ability to integrate multiple programming languages. If I were to enhance this code, I would first create more exception handling using try/catch statements and if statements. While I did include some exception handling, there still exists the potential for some unexpected inputs to cause error. The biggest challenge I had while creating this project was creating multiple classes which inherit from the abstract base class. In order to create a secure, compartmentalized code, I had to use various pointers and virtual functions which I was not very comfortable with heading into this project. There are many resources online that I found very helpful with cplusplus.com being the most informative. The ability to research and apply new terms is a skill that will translate well into all of my future classes and projects. To make this code easily maintainable and readable, I employed various industry best practices such as clear, concise comments and well spaced, compartmentalized code.
